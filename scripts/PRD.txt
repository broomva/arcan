# Overview

Arcan is an open-source AI-native meta-platform engineered to democratize the development, deployment, and governance of full-stack AI agents at scale. The platform addresses the complexity and fragmentation inherent in building sophisticated AI agentic systems by providing a unified, cohesive environment that enables organizations and individuals to translate ideas into functional AI infrastructure through natural language specifications - "from idea to infrastructure in a message."

The core problem Arcan solves is the current requirement to stitch together disparate tools for AI model orchestration, data management, user interface development, payment processing, and governance. By providing a comprehensive meta-platform, Arcan significantly lowers the go-to-market time for agentic companies and fosters a new wave of AI-driven entrepreneurship.

# Core Features

## 1. Unified Agent Definition System
- **What it does**: Provides a "one-source" model for agents encompassing UI context, event schemas, database models, and data lake schemas
- **Why it's important**: Ensures consistency across the entire system and eliminates integration friction
- **How it works**: JSON Schema serves as the single source of truth with automated code generation for Pydantic (Python) and TypeScript interfaces

## 2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- **What it does**: Serves as the data backbone using Kafka/streaming pipelines with transactional outbox pattern
- **Why it's important**: Enables decoupled, real-time, and resilient communication between services and agents
- **How it works**: All data flow traverses event streams with at-least-once delivery guarantees and idempotent consumers

## 3. Agentic Compute with LangGraph
- **What it does**: Enables creation of stateful, graph-structured agent workflows
- **Why it's important**: Supports complex, long-running, and collaborative multi-agent systems
- **How it works**: Agents are implemented as directed graphs where nodes represent tasks and edges represent data/control flow

## 4. Blockchain-Anchored Identity & Governance
- **What it does**: Provides decentralized identity for all participants and DAO-based platform governance
- **Why it's important**: Ensures trust, transparency, and community-driven evolution
- **How it works**: Leverages Thirdweb SDK for wallet management and ARC token for governance voting

## 5. Standardized Interoperability Protocols
- **What it does**: Native support for A2A, MCP, and AG-UI protocols
- **Why it's important**: Enables seamless agent-to-agent, agent-to-data, and agent-to-UI communication
- **How it works**: Implements industry-standard protocols with JSON Schema validation

## 6. Integrated Monetization & Payment Rails
- **What it does**: Built-in payment gateway supporting fiat and crypto transactions
- **Why it's important**: Enables agents to charge for services and transact autonomously
- **How it works**: Integrates Wedi Pay with MCP-based payment protocol

## 7. Self-Improving AI with Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR)
- **What it does**: Enables agents to autonomously improve their reasoning capabilities
- **Why it's important**: Reduces reliance on manual updates and human-labeled data
- **How it works**: Self-play mechanism with code executor for reinforcement learning
